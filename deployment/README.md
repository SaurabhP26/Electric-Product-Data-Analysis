## Technologies Used

- PySpark for large-scale data processing
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data visualization
- Dash for interactive web dashboards

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the Python virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the data processing scripts: `python src/processing/main.py`
6. Launch the dashboard: `python src/dashboard/app.py`

## Impact

- 40% reduction in data processing time
- 30% improvement in query performance
- 20% improvement in sales strategies through actionable insights
